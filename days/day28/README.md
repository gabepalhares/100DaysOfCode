### Day twenty-eight of #100DaysOfCode

- I decided to finish all the pending projects I was working on, which included my personal website and my Zettelkasten.

- On my webpage, I improved the responsiveness and created a new page called "cv," where I added download options for my resume in both English and Portuguese.
- I created several components to present the resume not only as downloadable PDFs but also as a live page, bringing all the information to life. I was very happy with the result.
