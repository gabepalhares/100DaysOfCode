### Day sixteen of #100DaysOfCode

I got sick this weekend and started the week off on a rough note. I couldn't do the things I had planned, but I'm working on getting better.
This week, I'll finish my personal blog and write another article. Jeff gave me the idea to write an article about building the blog, and I found that very interesting, so I'll probably invest time in that too.
The studies on React and Node.js are ongoing. I'm excited to research more about Three.js and implement it on my personal website.
