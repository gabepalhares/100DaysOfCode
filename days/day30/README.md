### Day thirty of #100DaysOfCode

- I finally managed to fix the deployment; everything is working! I was very happy and moved on to working on the Zettelkasten. It will soon be just the way I planned.
- I completed all the details for my "now page," which is already deployed on my personal website. As soon as I finished, I contacted the author of the movement and sent my details so he could add them to the official page. I am very excited and happy to have made this decision.
- With the Zettelkasten working and my website nearly ready, I'm already thinking about what project to work on next. I need to create a full-stack project with CRUD functionality, using TypeScript, React.js, and Node.js, as this is missing from my portfolio. I also need to work on SQL and NoSQL database manipulation. A Go API should be coming soon as well.
