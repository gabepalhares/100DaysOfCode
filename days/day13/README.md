### Day thirteen of #100DaysOfCode


It's funny how often we lose an entire day due to a small distraction. Yesterday was my day off; it was Sunday, a day when I usually take a break from Saturday's work and plan what I'll do in the upcoming week.
I study and try to develop my personal projects. In the morning, a friend invited me to go cycling. Upon arriving there, faced with his lack of enthusiasm, we ended up giving up, and I ended up just staying at his house, chatting, watching TV, scrolling through Instagram Reels, and that was it.
Before I realized it, it was already the end of the day, and I ended up not being able to do anything of what I usually feel comfortable doing.
At night, I read an article from The Odin Project, and a sentence struck me a lot: __"As a beginner, the day you code is the day you've won."__
Yesterday, I didn't code; I lost. But I'm recording it here as a reminder not to make mistakes like this again, as I ended the day without cycling and without coding.
