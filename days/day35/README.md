### Day thirty-five of #100DaysOfCode

I finished the MTB Shop project, built with Next.js. It was a lot of fun, and with it, I was able to apply some Next.js concepts that I had never used before, such as SSG and SSR, as well as good SEO practices and how to use API Routes. It was also my first time using Stitches, a really cool CSS-in-JS tool. There are just a few small tweaks left, and I need to create a good README page.

I made some adjustments to my LinkedIn profile and I'm quite happy with the result. I created a new cover image, added previous experiences, and made the public URL private, leaving only essential information visible. Now I need to update my resume again and get back to job hunting.
