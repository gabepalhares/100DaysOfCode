### Day nineteen of #100DaysOfCode

Yeah, a lot has happened since I got sick. I had to pause several projects and make various decisions. I started working in another field while I don't get an opportunity as a software developer.
Unfortunately, I ended up pausing this project here as well, but today I'm restarting it.

I've set a new study routine and planned my next steps, looking forward to seeing where it will all take me. Feeling satisfied, happy, and healthy.
