### Day twenty-nine of #100DaysOfCode

- I configured some files for the Zettelkasten and am working on fixing the deployment. I also edited several files that are part of the documentation and markdown files, where the content will be present. I hope to finish fixing the deployment soon.

- Through reading some articles, I discovered a page called "now," and also a movement with the same name. It's basically a digital space where people share everything they are doing at the current moment. I found it very interesting and liked the idea, so I decided to implement it on my personal website.

- I created my "now" page and brainstormed ideas about what content to include on it.
