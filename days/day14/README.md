### Day fourteen of #100DaysOfCode

I delved into the development of my next article, 'Rabbit Holes and How to Avoid Them,' and believe that tomorrow morning I will be able to finish it. Additionally, I had more ideas for the upcoming topics I will be writing about.

I made progress in the development of my personal blog using `Astro.js`. It has been very enjoyable to explore the documentation and every possibility offered by this tool. I am also working extensively with `Tailwind`, using only the documentation as a reference. I feel more confident and independent.

However, I have the desire to further improve and optimize my time. I plan to publish two articles this week and conclude both my personal blog and my resume. I've decided that in terms of the tech stack, I will move forward with Next.js, and on the backend, I want to learn Rust. Let's see where this will lead.
