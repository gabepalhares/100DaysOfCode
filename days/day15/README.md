### Day fifteen of #100DaysOfCode

I finished and published my third article: [Rabbit Holes and When to Avoid Them](https://dev.to/gabriel-palhares/rabbit-holes-and-when-to-avoid-them-4dae).
I am in the final adjustments of my blog and hope to have it online by tomorrow.
The next step is to create a simple and objective personal website, featuring my resume and completed/in-progress projects.

I studied `Node.js and Streams`; the next step will be to create a `REST API`.
I talked to Jeff Quesado, who suggested some simple but relevant changes to my article, and that was really helpful.
I applied for `7 positions` that I wasn't finding some time ago, which has left me optimistic.
