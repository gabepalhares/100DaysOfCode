### Day seventeen of #100DaysOfCode

I recovered after taking some medicine and focused on finishing the week well. I completed my personal blog; however, I encountered issues when deploying it due to some outdated configurations on Arch Linux.
So, I started researching ways to resolve this.

I wrote two more articles: ["Your Tech Career Should be Like a Motorsport"](https://dev.to/gabriel-palhares/your-tech-career-should-be-like-a-motorsport-2g2g) and 
["Mountain Bikes and Code: Making the Best Decisions to Become Senior".](https://dev.to/gabriel-palhares/mountain-bikes-and-code-making-the-best-decisions-to-become-senior-436j)
I was very happy with the results of these specifically because I managed to blend hobbies from my personal life with my work and studies.

I had an idea for a project involving TL;DRs of 'tech bubble' podcasts, and I am putting it into practice. Let's see how far it will go!

Over the weekend, I participated in a cycling tour in honor of the 272 victims of the tragedy caused by Vale. After the tour, I cycled more than 80km with my friend Matheus; it was very beneficial for me.
