### Day five of #100DaysOfCode

I've just started week 3 of the Harvard CS50 course, where I watched the Algorithms lecture covering the following topics: linear search, binary search, running time, search.c, data structures, sorting, selection sort, bubble sort, algorithm comparison, and how to best apply them in different situations. It also covered recursion and merge sort. The next step is to watch the section and shorts for the week, and then proceed to solve lab 3 and the problem set.

In university, I had the first class of descriptive statistics, where primary concepts such as population and sample were covered. The class also discussed classifications of variables and types of sampling methods.
