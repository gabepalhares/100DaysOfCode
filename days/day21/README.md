### Day twenty-one of #100DaysOfCode

The day was all about searching for job openings and applying for them. I updated my resume to an ATS-friendly model. Now I need to make it in English, but until now, there hasn't been a need, as all the job postings I found were Brazilian.

I'm eager to change companies, but I need to get back to studying the specific processes for technical challenges: algorithms, coding problem-solving, specific details of languages and frameworks, things that we tend to forget over time.

I will continue with the CS50 and the Ignite track; I want to finish this stage of courses as quickly as possible so that I can create my own projects and have something relevant and unique to show publicly.

Personal notes: I'm happy with my progress at the gym, it's undeniable how much it affects my self-esteem and energy. I'm quite distant from my friends, almost considering going back to Instagram, but I still have a very strong mental block, along with anxiety. In the end, I think I'll continue without it and keep my promise. Other than that, aside from some important decisions I need to make, everything is going well.
