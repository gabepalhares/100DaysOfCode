### Day six of #100DaysOfCode

In college, in the Software Process Quality course, we covered topic 2: Software Design and Software Project Management. This topic highlighted the key requirements for the execution and planning of a software project, as well as their rules and the importance of each one. In this context, software project management involves techniques for estimating work effort for specified requirements, negotiated deadlines, costs, and other variables discussed within the project's scope.

I also started a course that covers the new tools introduced when Java 8 was released. Undoubtedly, this was one of the most important updates as it significantly evolved Java and revolutionized the way of working with it. The key features include Default Methods, Lambdas, Method References, Streams, Collectors, and the Date API.
