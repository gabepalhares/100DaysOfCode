### Day six of #100DaysOfCode

In college, in the Software Process Quality course, we covered topic 2: Software Design and Software Project Management. This topic highlighted the key requirements for the execution and planning of a software project, as well as their rules and the importance of each one. In this context, software project management involves techniques for estimating work effort for specified requirements, negotiated deadlines, costs, and other variables discussed within the project's scope.
