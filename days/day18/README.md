### Day eighteen of #100DaysOfCode

Just built [PodBits](https://github.com/gabriel-palhares/podbits)! After a few days on pause because I needed to help my family, I returned to putting my ideas into practice, and one of them was the construction of PodBits.

I have plans to add a TLDR of different podcasts each week. In addition to that, I have also started creating my personal website and need to adjust my blog before deploying it.

This week has been a bit challenging because I think I caught 'dengue' fever. Lots of headaches, muscle pains, and fever. But I am resting and taking care of myself, hoping to get back to 100% soon.
