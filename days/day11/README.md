### Day eleven of #100DaysOfCode

I reorganized my routine to optimize my performance. I began by breaking down each task I need to accomplish and also considered how many times I would do each one throughout the weeks.
I believe that the best way to improve my study performance is by better organization while ensuring I put everything into practice, of course.
I started my studies in React.js, learning about the fundamentals and components. Additionally, I continued to focus on Algorithms.

I'm nearing the end of the semester at college, so I'll need to dedicate a lot of attention to that.
So I'm going to have full and challenging days because of this, but I'm motivated and focused on giving my best. I want to do everything in my power to shorten the time it takes to land my first job in tech.
From now on, I will focus on learning and building web applications using JS/Typescript, React.js, and Node.js
