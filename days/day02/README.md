### Day two of #100DaysOfCode

- Still completing week 2 of Harvard's CS50, I watched the lecture and the shorts related to the main content, which was Arrays. The next step to finish the week is to perform the code tests and solve the challenges.

- I continued with the Alura course I'm taking related to Java development. In the class of the day, I learned basic concepts of java.io and the usage of streams, readers, and writers. I learned how to open files, read them line by line, detect the end, and how to use Java.io exceptions for unexpected events.

- In the evening, instead of having a class at the university, I had a meeting with the project group for alignment and planning of what will be worked on.
