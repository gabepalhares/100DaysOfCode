### Day two of #100DaysOfCode

- Still completing week 2 of Harvard's CS50, I watched the lecture and the shorts related to the main content, which was Arrays. The next step to finish the week is to perform the code tests and solve the challenges.

- I continued with the Alura course I'm taking related to Java development. In the class of the day, I learned basic concepts of java.io and the usage of streams, readers, and writers. I learned how to open files, read them line by line, detect the end, and how to use Java.io exceptions for unexpected events.

- In the evening, instead of having a class at the university, I had a meeting with the project group for alignment and planning of what will be worked on.

- I began reviewing Git through "curso.dev." In the class of the day, the following topics were covered:

`git log` - lists the commits in the repository;<br>
`git add` - stages changes for commit;<br>
`git commit` - creates new commits;<br>
`git commit --amend` - replaces the previous commit with a new one, but includes its changes;<br>
`git diff` - calculates the difference between file versions/changes.<br>

All of these commands work offline in Git and can be used without needing an internet connection, as none of them transmit information outside of your computer.
