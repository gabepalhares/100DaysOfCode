### Day thirty-six of #100DaysOfCode

Well, it's time to get back to React Timer, a project I left behind some time ago. It's been cool because I'm refreshing and practicing a lot of React rules and tools. This week, I also applied for some jobs. My college project just started, so I need to focus on it.

I learned and read a lot about functional programming and even got excited about learning Elixir and Phoenix, but I think it's beyond my level right now. I'll just keep learning Go and work on the one billion rows challenge. More updates soon.
