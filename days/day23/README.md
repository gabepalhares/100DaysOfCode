### Day twenty-three of #100DaysOfCode

Tech: I'm studying and practicing more with Node.js and Fastify. The goal is to definitely master REST APIs and after that, dive into Nest.js, which is part of the stack I want to master. I just applied for more jobs, and for the rest of the week, I want to make a CV in English, update some details in my portfolio, and keep going.

Personal: I'm so happy that I started journaling. I just bought a small notebook to save my thoughts and let everything flow. I'm really into playing football, and this makes me so happy. Today is my mom's birthday, and I'll have dinner with her. Good days.
