### Day thirty-seven of #100DaysOfCode

I have defined some professional goals and clarified some doubts about the paths to take. While browsing through content that inspires me, I had two new project ideas and am excited to start working on them.

The first project is called `Memoria`, a personal photo gallery created to replace Instagram, serving as a new way to share special moments online without wasting time and avoiding distractions.

The second project is called `Labs`, which is simply a page dedicated solely to showcasing all of my projects, both frontend and backend. I got the idea after seeing a personal website with a similar page and realized that this was something missing in my personal "ecosystem."

Camila contacted me about the progress of my college work, and after this week's meeting, I believe things will flow, and I'll be able to get started. In the morning, I sent some emails to interesting companies near me and the university.
