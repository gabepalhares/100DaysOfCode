### Day thirty-eight of #100DaysOfCode

I managed to maintain a very good development pace and built the Labs in two days. I have already deployed it to production, and I also deployed other projects, such as the MTB Shop. Now, I just need to make some responsiveness adjustments.

The next project I need to focus on is the one for college, and to complete my portfolio, the Memoria project. I hope to achieve good results with them in the coming days. Today was a day when I had to fast, take medication, and undergo exams, so I'm not feeling well and haven't recovered yet.

I hope to get back on track soon!
