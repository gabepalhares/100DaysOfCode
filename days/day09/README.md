An **API**(Applcation Programming Interface) is a set of rules and mechanisms by which one application or component interacts with the others.

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is basically the interpretation of it.

A REST API is the most common standard used between Clients (a person or application) who want to access information from the web from Servers (application or database) who have access to that information.

**CRUD** stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. **JSON** is a syntax for storing and exchanging data. JSON is compatible with all programming languages meaning that when we're using RESTful APIs we can communicate with any application no matter what the app was actually written.
Relies on HTTP protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

| HTTP | POST | GET | PUT | DELETE |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **SQL** | INSERT | SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE |
| **CRUD** | **C**REATE | **R**EAD | **U**PDATE | **D**ELETE |

Whenever you make an http request a status code gets returned. These are the 5 major ones:

1xx - informational;

2xx - success;

3xx - redirection;

4xx - client error;

5xx - server error.
