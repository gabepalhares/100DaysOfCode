### Day ten of #100DaysOfCode

I had a call with Sibelius, and after that, I had a big reality check. Initially, it was challenging to process all the points he raised. I became quite reflective and took a few days to reorient myself. I decided to plan more effectively and create several steps to achieve my goals. Changing the stack was the most drastic change, starting to expose myself more, practicing 'learn in public,' and literally getting my hands dirty. I have high expectations, but now I'm grounded in reality and aware that I must be patient.

After completing this interview cycle, I will focus more on my studies and the more conceptual aspects, delving deep into each subject and giving it my all, as if my life depended on it (because it does).
