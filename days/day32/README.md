### Day thirty-two of #100DaysOfCode

- I just finished CS50 from Harvard, as I planned a while ago. It was a great experience, and to complete it, I had to upload a YouTube video showing my final project before submitting it to them. I recorded the video with OBS and used an AI voice generator to handle the narration parts of the video.

- I started feeding my Zettelkasten with more content; this time it's Extreme Programming. I am almost finished with everything on this subject.

- Now I will start the Colt Steele Algorithms and Data Structures course on Udemy, while also studying more about JavaScript and TypeScript syntax through Exercism.
