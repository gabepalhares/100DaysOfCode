### Day twenty of #100DaysOfCode

I am returning after having paused my studies and the attempt to get started in the field. I am working in another sector, and thanks to that, I have money to support myself until I reach my main goals.

I was very discouraged with college, but I will try to turn things around and reconcile with the professor and the semester project. Just 2 more semesters and I'll get there. It's better to try than to throw everything away and waste all the time, money, and effort.

Moreover, I believe the stack I will focus on will be an attempt to maximize Javascript to the fullest.

Front-end: Javascript, Typescript, React, Vue

Back-end: Node, Fastify, C#, .NET Core

Database: PostgreSQL, Mongo, Redis
