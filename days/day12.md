### Day twelve of #100DaysOfCode


I have been feeling quite torn in the past few days. I feel that I have made progress and am happy, but I realize many things I should have done and couldn't. I believe this is a consequence of wanting to embrace the world and do too many things at once. This 100 days of code challenge has turned into one of them. I noticed that my last update was two months ago, and I felt quite discouraged. I want to make the most of this experience, so I need to dedicate myself.

I started writing articles as I had planned and am happy with the results. I began building my blog, which is a significant step toward my goal. I learned a lot about Tailwind just by practicing and reading the documentation, without the need for any courses.

I have to create my plans for 2024 and outline a strategy on how to land my job as a junior developer. I already have some ideas and will put them into action to present to Sibelius.

It is challenging to make plans when you don't have much confidence and hope for the future. But I feel that I'm capable of making whatever it takes to become a better person and achieve my goals.
