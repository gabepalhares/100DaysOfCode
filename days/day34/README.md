### Day thirty-four of #100DaysOfCode

I started the MTB Shop project, a bike store built with Next.js. My goal is to finish it this weekend and deepen my knowledge of Next.

I applied for a position at a company that caught my attention. I’m eager to try to convince them to hire me as a Frontend Intern. I’ll use the project I’m working on as my main presentation tool.

I changed classes at university and managed to avoid the professor who negatively impacted me last semester. I hope everything goes well this semester, and I will do my best to complete everything without flaws or gaps that could hinder me.

I also worked on Podbits, where I built a new page listing all the podcasts covered by the project, along with a brief description. I also added a new transcript of a podcast from Brave discussing payment methods and the innovation of Pix in Brazil.
