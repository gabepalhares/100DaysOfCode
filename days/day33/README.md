### Day thirty-three of #100DaysOfCode

I just finished all of the content on Extreme Programming and deployed it to my Zettelkasten.

You can check it out at this link: https://gabrielpalhares.dev/garden/category/extreme-programming.

I'm proud because everything is going well, as planned, and the progress makes me happy.

- My college classes started up again this week, and I'm a bit anxious about the semester project. I hope it goes well this time.

- I want to post on X almost every day, or maybe every week, with TIL (Today I Learned) topics. I like this type of content, and creating my own is a good way to record progress and share in public.

- I also want to finish my studies in algorithms and DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms).
