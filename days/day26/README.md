### Day twenty-six of #100DaysOfCode

Day dedicated to personal projects. Thinking of using Podbits as my final project submission for the Harvard CS50 course, I made some adjustments to the code and also implemented the `reading-time` feature, which displays the approximate reading time of text content. Specifically, I used this feature in the `Card.astro` component and also in the layout of posts containing Podbits.

I was very happy to have been able to implement this quickly and solely following the Astro documentation. Considering writing a mini-article, as this could be very useful for content creators who enjoy writing.
