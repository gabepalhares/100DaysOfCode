### Day seven of #100DaysOfCode

I began the seventh day by studying automated testing in Java using JUnit. I started with introductory knowledge, where I went from understanding the importance of using automated tests in a project to actually beginning to practice and put this knowledge into code. As a result, I learned how to add JUnit to the project, write automated tests with JUnit, and execute and analyze the test execution results.

The next step after that was to delve into TDD: Test-Driven Development, where I studied the fundamental concept, what it is, how to write a feature using TDD, and how to effectively refactor both the code and the tests.

Testing - Implementation - Refactoring (repeat)

Finally, I began to delve into how to work with and handle exceptions when testing specific methods that might throw them.
