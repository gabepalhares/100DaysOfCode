### Day thirty-one of #100DaysOfCode

- I revised and rewrote `70%` of an old article that I had worked on but was not satisfied with the result. This time, I feel it turned out exactly as I initially wanted.
- After the revision, I republished it on `dev.to` and also on my personal website, which now looks very good.
- I also fixed responsiveness issues on the blog using `Tailwind` and creating `custom classes`, which I had never done before. It was quite cool, and Iâ€™m very pleased with the result.
- I fixed a `bug` with the site's `scrollbar` that was creating two duplicate elements and affecting the visual appearance. Everything is now working well, looking good, and corrected.
