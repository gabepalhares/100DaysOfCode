### Day three of #100DaysOfCode

I studied the following topics related to Java.io's writing and flexibility:
- Writing to files;<br>
- Writing using different outputs;<br>
- Reading and writing data abstracting implementation;<br>
- Abstract and concrete classes for writing and reading.

In the university lecture, I started the subject of "Software Requirements Management." In the first topic, concepts of software requirements were covered, including the importance of stakeholders and how to classify them. Activities related to requirements management were discussed, such as traceability and analysis. After this lecture, I began a soft skills training focused on emotional intelligence in the workplace.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend any classes from Harvard's CS50 today.

Continuing with the Git course I chose to review my knowledge, today I studied the following commands:

`git commit -m "message"` - shortcut to create new commits;<br>
`git push` - push local changes to the origin;<br>
`it push --force` - forcefully push local changes to the origin;<br>
`git push -f` - the compressed form of the previous command.
