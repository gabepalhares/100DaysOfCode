### Day twenty-four of #100DaysOfCode

Tech: Alright, so I just did what I planned and updated my personal page, solving some issues and uploading a new CV in both Portuguese and English versions. The next step is to deploy my Zettelkasten with Docusaurus; I'm having some problems trying to do it for the first time. I also need to go back to work and review some topics that I'm learning.

Personal: I just got new football glasses to play with. Now I have new cleats and don't need anything more to enjoy playing. I think this Sunday there will be another game, and I hope to enjoy it. I'm pretty happy with my frequent gym visits and have finally gained some weight. I'm taking care of my plants, trying to recover them from the cold and mold. The next step is to put some NPK 10-10-10 on them. My grandfather found a lost cockatiel and brought her home, so I'm taking care of her too.
