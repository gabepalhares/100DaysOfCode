### Day one of #100DaysOfCode

- Today I continued completing the lessons from Harvard's CS50. I'm in week 2, and the lecture I watched was about Arrays and the various ways to declare them, using the C language, along with many underlying details.

- In my college class, it was a day to study Project Management. Currently, I'm in Unit 1, and I watched all the lessons of Theme 1, which covered basic concepts such as project terminology, what project management is, how the project lifecycle works, and how a project is initiated.

- At the end of the day, I had the idea to create this repository and organize the entire table in markdown, to structure and enhance the accessibility of all the content I plan to record in this 100 Days of Code challenge. I also organized my entire study plan based on the college curriculum using Notion.
